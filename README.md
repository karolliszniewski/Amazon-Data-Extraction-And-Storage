This project involves rewriting my C# program, originally developed using Selenium, into a PHP version.

The idea is to have Selenium extract data from the website, and then a PHP script interprets that code and inserts it into the database, instead of doing everything in C# and Selenium, where each program needs to have interpretation classes separately installed, making it challenging to centralize.
